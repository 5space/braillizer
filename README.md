Convert an image into Braille ASCII art
=======================================

Very very very experimental, very very very rough and personal project.

Instructions
------------

Run `python index.py > red.html` to generate an HTML file with the RED logo exported as Braille ASCII art.

Or open the existing `red.html` to see the result.
